# Applied-Deep-Learning

This repo has a number of very useful applied deep learning notebooks. The following notebooks include:

1. **columbia-landmarks** - building a dnn model to classify manually collected pictures of 5 landmarks on Columbia's campu
2. **color-classification** - using rnn and dnn models to improve a color classification linear model
3. **hyperparameter-experiments** - playing with various deep learning model hyperparameters to see how performance (validation accuracy) can be improved.
4. **fashion-mnist** - simply mnist classification tutorial with dnn model
5. **browser-classification** - text classifier build to work using javascript in browser based on a pre-trained model
